  story: `With over a decade of experience in the art world, my journey began in the vibrant streets of Brooklyn. 
    My work explores the intersection of urban life and natural forms, creating a unique dialogue between structure and chaos.
    Through my paintings, I aim to capture the essence of modern existence while paying homage to classical techniques.`,
